							<h2>More than four years as a developer</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Working remotely</div>
							</div>
							<p>I decided to dust up the old blog to see where I've started to where I am now. It's been a long grueling process to say the least.
							</p>
							<p>In my previous position, I worked in a team of 7 developers but the main developer team was between 45-50 developers in total. The environment was very structured and indeed hard. I eventually rose up from junior developer 
								to senior developer in my short time frame. However, I learned how to develop standards along the way while mentoring my junior developers. Our record of 100+ points in two weeks hasn't been beaten :)
								I left that position after 2.5 years on the job and wanted an increase to my salary at the same time learning something new. I'm definitely grateful to Alex stating once you get comfortable as a dev it's time to go.
							</p>
							<p>Therefore, I've put myself in situations where I'm learning something new on the job. I know there's a status quo when implementing a solution. However, when that solution is deprecated I start questioning is it worth it?
								Maybe it's because I come from a Cybersecurity background where I have to run my code constantly for bugs and errors before it hits production...
							</p>
							<p>However, it is your responsibility as a developer to set standards for yourself - whether by commenting code, mentoring, peer programming, and etc. I've also come to find out in my career it's not the years of experience but what 
							type of experience you gained.

							<h2>Five month anniversary</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Working remotely</div>
							</div>
							<p>Wow! Time flies when you're learning. I would never imagine my one month anniversary
								would also be the same
								month we headed in to lockdown. It's been quite the process. There's no peer coding in
								person anymore due to
								the Coronavirus. As a result, attacking features now requires constant communication via
								email, screenshare, and RocketChat.
							</p>
							<p>When I first joined the team, the workload seemed daunting as well as the coding process.
								I've learned a lot
								since then. I've resided in literally the 'full stack development.' From network, to
								database and stored procedures, to
								C# and Restful APIs, data dictionaries, to using Pipe transforms in Angular/Javascript
								as well as observables. It's a lot to take in.
								I'm always learning. When there's a new feature to attack I ask how to attack the
								problem, is there a similar method
								where this is used? I now know where to modify the code.
							</p>
							<p>The tough parts I've experienced are unit testing and merge conflicts. Writing testable
								code isn't easy. It's
								not console log this or that via the DOM model. You have to take in to account the code
								timing (i.e. setting timeout).
								Unit testing is harder on the frontend than the backend since it tends to be more
								finicky. Little modifications in the
								UI can break the test.
							</p>
							<p>Merge conflicts are not my cup of tea. I remember working on a feature which I was pumped
								to complete. However, I pulled
								from develop merged the source code with my branch. It broke my branch. I didn't know
								what to do and how to fix it.
								I was at a standstill and had to ask my lead to fix my item. I come to find out that
								Angular had some nuances compared to
								other Frameworks (i.e React and Vue) I didn't know about.
							</p>
							<p>My team has been really supportive through this entire process as well as our weekly
								developer guilds. My guild
								makes sure that every developer is on the same page from coding standards, to learning
								new technologies, to UI/UX, and
								using in built methods and why we use them.

										<h2>One month anniversary</h2>
										<div class="blog-metas">
											<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
											<div class="blog-meta">Job</div>
										</div>
										<p>The first week was drinking out of the firehose from my previous post. Now
											everything is slowing down as I'm
											getting my bearings in this new job. I think all new developers are afraid
											of the 'onboarding' process. The
											onboarding process is where you learn how the system and code flow. Don't
											worry about making mistakes. This
											is why you're a junior right? ^_^
										</p>
										<p>Some companies emphasize a sink or swim approach to the process. Can you
											figure it out yourself? The caveat
											do you know the system more than the senior developers or database
											engineers? Likely no, the best way to approach
											this situation is to ask for help? Is there a similar method in the code
											where x, y, or z is implemented. Your team
											will be happy (not all teams) to assist you. If you don't ask questions,
											your team automatically assumes you understand
											the processes. Remember the dumbest question to ask, is the one you don't...
										</p>
										<p>Similar to Github from Coding Dojo we develop on branches. I didn't even know
											how to set mine up and messed up repeatedly
											because I failed to do the naming convention. Also make sure you are on your
											branch as you develop your 'feature.' I have
											done this quite a bit and had to do a git stash and pop. That isn't good to
											use. As you push code, make sure you understand
											merge conflicts. Your code may override your teammates code as well as their
											work. This is why Coding Dojo should
											emphasize using group projects as well as the git merge process. You'll
											thank me later.
										</p>
										<p>I'm definitely blessed with a team that teaches me constantly (collaboration
											days) and allows me to make mistakes (not on purpose ;) ). If you
											don't have a good environment to learn, it will be harder to grasp concepts.
											In your spare time, try to learn on the side any
											challenges impeding your work. Remember always communicate to your team any
											impediments you're having, so you can get your work done.
											Yesterday, I couldn't grab an observable properly because I used way too
											many brackets. Sometimes a fresh pair of eyes helps get you through.

											<p>I've been working with the Autism society to get some of their websites
												up to code (...literally).</p>
											<p>My task was to support this static website in PHP (which isn't my cup of
												tea). I can't stand it. Sorry to you PHP lovers.
											</p>
											<p>
												<em>The client told me they want their website to be:</em>
												<br>
												A. Responsive
												<br>
												B. Login/Registration (thank you Coding Dojo for those Python and C#
												belt exams)
												<br>
												C. The website must support multiple languages
												<br>
												D. Colorblind users
												<br>
												E. Realtime Facebook and Twitter feed
												<br>
												F. Calendar of Events
												<br>
												G. Must accept payments (Paypal for user yearly fees)
												<br>
												H. Implement a lottery system
												<br>
												I. Implement a digital wall
											</p>
											<p>I mentioned to the Senior Developer that the website needs a huge
												overhaul. He stated the only way he will allow any changes is to develop
												a wireframe and make a dummy website.
												I am so tempted:
												A. Cheat and Wordpress the living heck out of it
												B. Apply a Framework like Angular or React
											</p>
											<p>Did I mention I have only 2 weeks to complete this :(</p>

												<h2>Tackling a non technical interview</h2>
												<div class="blog-metas">
													<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
													<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
												</div>
												<p>Majority of my interviews have been technical. It usually starts out:
													HR contacts you, technical
													interview with conceptual questions in regards to the code, coding
													challenge, in person interview (2
													parts the technical and the behavorial). </p>
												<p>What makes a non technical interview harder? Your resume. How can I
													sell myself? Resumes only show a
													small part of the candidate. My interview last Monday was laid back
													which was refreshing for once
													instead of the stressful I'm going to pullout my hair. I was in a
													panel interview with 2 Senior
													Developers and 1 Project Manager. The Project Manager was really
													friendly and was an advocate in my
													corner. However, coming in as a junior you will be
													under scrutiny. What is your source control? How are you applying
													your software coding to security
													standards in a DISA format? When the lead developer says they have
													40000 vulnerabilities
													alone in the code, you get kind of apprehensive. Looking back at all
													my Github repositories it makes me
													question maybe I should of called a certain object or variable
													differently. However, don't take these
													interviews lightly. Sometimes, they're even harder than the
													technical ones.</p>

													</div>
													<p>Where do I fit?</p>
													<p>Am I one of the three?</p>
													<p>If you're Front-End be preparded for a tougher process than
														backend or full stack. Remember Front-End is the face of the
														website. Do you believe a company will allow you to code their
														multimillion dollar app with nothing but CSS and HTML? The
														answer is...<em>No.</em>
														You will go through multiple interviews. I have been through 4
														levels of the interviewing process for a front end position. The
														HR, technical with the senior developer, coding challenge, and
														the in person.
														Your Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX skills have to be on point. Do
														you know the difference between null vs undefined? What is
														hoisting? Lifecycles of different frameworks (Angular vs React
														vs Vue)?
													</p>
													<p>If you're Back-End you will have the standard coding challenge.
														If you pass it, you make it to the final interview with the
														hiring manager and team. Don't forget about whiteboarding..</p>
													<p>If you're Full-Stack be prepared to make an app that is both
														pretty and functional. It's the same process as the Back-End.

															<div class="blog-meta">Applying</div>
														</div>
														<p>Should I apply directly to the company?</p>
														<p>..or should I use a Staffing Agency?</p>
														<p>The answer is it depends. To get your foot through the door
															most candidates go through a staffing agency. Usually, these
															agencies are 6 month contracts
															that will eventually lead to a permanent position (depending
															on your performance).
														</p>
														<p>If you apply directly, there is no middle man. However, it
															will take some time depending how big the HR team is.
															Sometimes, you get an interview right away.</p>
