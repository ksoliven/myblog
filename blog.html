							<h2>Final Technical Interview</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
							</div>
							<p>I had my technical interview this past Wednesday. The cool part it was at Starbucks. The technical in person was very similar to my CACI interview but more on the technical side (it is a technical interview).</p>
							<p>It was very similar to my CACI interview in terms of the laid back attitude. As my brother says, just be yourself.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Here's a list:</p>
							<br>
							<p><em>Using Git. Elaborate on it.</em></p>
							<br>
							 I know at Coding Dojo we used it for source code control. We had to do the standard commits and inits. I have done git pull requests
							 However, working in a team you have to make use of <em>merge.</em> I'll be honest I have not used merge before. One reason we never worked in
							 team projects. Git merge would really be helpful for that scenario. That's what I emphasize doing group projects at Coding Dojo to get a taste 
							 for another team member's code and make it work with yours.
							<p><em>C#. How long have you coded it? Error checking? IDE of choice? and...LINQ queries</em></p>
							 <br>
							 My C# experience has been with the Dojo itself. Many people tend to learn C# to get in to game development, especially with Unity. Many game developers
							 still use C++ as their go to language. I'm not fond of it as it's not error friendly compared to C#. A memory leak is not an error that elaborates where it's happening at in your line 
							 of code. The error code checking I've done is pretty much my try catch method or the standard console log. With majority of software companies they tend to run
							 their code through a script that scans it. This goes through a test driven development process. Yes. I'm looking at you QA employees. For IDE I admitted I love Atom because it looks pretty. However,
							 if you're using C#, VS code is your go to. There's an extension I have to download for error checking. In terms of LINQ, I definitely think the Dojo should elaborate on it. In all my C# technical interviews, LINQ queries are important. Many
							 applications are moving away from legacy software like Silverlight and upgrading their applications in the process. Some applications still use a database like SQL where it's heavy on the statements.
							<p><em>Angular. Javascript. Typescript. How did you use it?</em></p>
							<br>
							<p>They asked me about my Angular experience. I used it at the Dojo during my last stack. I explained the promises and observables (especially with ES5 and ES6 standards). I did mention that I've done Vanilla Javascript as well. The interviewer asked me if I've coded a full application and I mentioned I did but it was all in Javascript.</p>
							<br>
							<p><em>Microlibraries?</em></p>
							<p>I got confused by this question. The libraries I remember from C# were importing like LINQ. I admitted I've used APIs in my coding standards especially with Javascript. I would love to apply an API with Python in the future, especially with the rise of machine learning (I'm looking at your Alexa).</p>
					                <br>
							<p>There were some more questions but there was so much data crammed that I forgot. Seriously, these C# technical interviews are looking more and more similar to each other. It's uncanny. I want to give a shoutout to Anaba! Have a safe trip! ^_^</p>

							<h2>Interview with CACI</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
							</div>
							<p>I had my interview with CACI yesterday. I'll be honest I did apply to this job on a whim. My brother had told me why don't apply to CACI. He had been with the company for 10 years. Ed had nothing but amazing things to say about them. He mentioned if it wasn't for them
							his network engineering career wouldn't have gotten this far. In the end, he said: "just be yourself sis."
							</p><p>Originally my interview was supposed to be a 6 panel interview with the team. Majority of the team was out of town due to Thanksgiving week. It went from
							6 to 2 people. I know at Boeing I had a 5 person interview where I had to do ERD diagraming and scripting.</p>
							<p>The project manager was cool. He seemed so nice and down to Earth. The PMs in my past have either been high strung (sends an email at 2am and expects a response at that time) or MIA. I really don't know which is worse. He was more 
							about behavorial questions, previous projects, working in an agile environment, team structure, how do you learn?, etc.
							</p>
							<p>The second interviewer was one of their senior developers. He seemed pretty chill as well. The developer asked:</p>
							<br>
							<p>Penetration testing and Python</p>
							<p>C# projects and what they do</p>
							<p>Validation libraries (I've made a custom validator but usually everything is hardcoded in)</p>
							<p>Object Relational Mapping - ERD Diagraming with SQL</p>
							<p>Frontend, Backend, which do you prefer?</p>
							<p>Javascript. Typescript. Explain it. How did you use it?</p>
							<br>
							<p>The questions were pretty straightforward. In retrospect, I could of elaborated on it more.
							</p>
							<p>Now to prepare for my next interview next Wednesday. I have to catch up on my old Python scripts and continuously learn C#. I still need to upload my old 'hacking' scripts to Github.</p>
							<p>Have a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

							<h2>How to approach a Senior Developer...</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Communication</div>
							</div>
							<p>I've been working with the Autism society to get some of their websites up to code (...literally).</p>
							<p>My task was to support this static website in PHP (which isn't my cup of tea). I can't stand it. Sorry to you PHP lovers. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The client told me they want their website to be:</em></p>
							<p>
							<br>
							A. Responsive
							<br>
							B. Login/Registration (thank you Coding Dojo for those Python and C# belt exams)
							<br>
							C. The website must support multiple languages
							<br>
							D. Colorblind users
							<br>
							E. Realtime Facebook and Twitter feed 
							<br>
							F. Calendar of Events
							<br>
							G. Must accept payments (Paypal for user yearly fees)
							<br>
							H. Implement a lottery system
							<br>
							I. Implement a digital wall
							</p> 
							<p>I mentioned to the Senior Developer that the website needs a huge overhaul. He stated the only way he will allow any changes is to develop a wireframe and make a dummy website. 
							<p>I am so tempted to:</p>
							<p>
							 A. Cheat and Wordpress the site in to the ground...
							<br> 
							 B. Apply a Framework like Angular or React
						        <br>
							 C. Do both?....
							</p>
							<p>Did I mention I have only 2 weeks to complete this :(</p>

									<h2>Tackling a non technical interview</h2>
									<div class="blog-metas">
										<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
										<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
									</div>
									<p>Majority of my interviews have been technical. It usually starts out: HR contacts you, technical
										interview with conceptual questions in regards to the code, coding challenge, in person interview (2
										parts the technical and the behavorial). </p>
									<p>What makes a non technical interview harder? Your resume. How can I sell myself? Resumes only show a
										small part of the candidate. My interview last Monday was laid back which was refreshing for once
										instead of the stressful I'm going to pullout my hair. I was in a panel interview with 2 Senior
										Developers and 1 Project Manager. The Project Manager was really friendly and was an advocate in my
										corner. However, coming in as a junior you will be
										under scrutiny. What is your source control? How are you applying your software coding to security
										standards in a DISA format? When the lead developer says they have 40000 vulnerabilities
										alone in the code, you get kind of apprehensive. Looking back at all my Github repositories it makes me
										question maybe I should of called a certain object or variable differently. However, don't take these
									interviews lightly. Sometimes, they're even harder than the technical ones.</p>

							<h2>Front-End Developer vs Back-End Developer vs Full Stack</h2>

								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Development</div>
							</div>
							<p>Where do I fit?</p>
							<p>Am I one of the three?</p>
							<p>If you're Front-End be prepared for a tougher process than backend or full stack. Remember Front-End is the face of the website. Do you believe a company will allow you to code their multimillion dollar app with nothing but CSS and HTML? The answer is...<em>No.</em>
							You will go through multiple interviews. I have been through 4 levels of the interviewing process for a front end position. The HR, technical with the senior developer, coding challenge, and the in person.
							Your Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX skills have to be on point. Do you know the difference between null vs undefined? What is hoisting? Lifecycles of different frameworks (Angular vs React vs Vue)?
							</p>
							<p>If you're Back-End you will have the standard coding challenge. If you pass it, you make it to the final interview with the hiring manager and team. Don't forget about whiteboarding..</p>
							<p>If you're Full-Stack be prepared to make an app that is both pretty and functional. It's the same process as the Back-End.</p>

								<h2>Apply Directly vs Staffing</h2>
								<div class="blog-metas">
									<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
									<div class="blog-meta">Applying</div>
								</div>
								<p>Should I apply directly to the company?</p>
								<p>..or should I use a Staffing Agency?</p>
								<p>The answer is it depends. To get your foot through the door most candidates go through a staffing agency. Usually, these agencies are 6 month contracts
								that will eventually lead to a permanent position (depending on your performance).
								</p>
								<p>If you apply directly, there is no middle man. However, it will take some time depending how big the HR team is. Sometimes, you get an interview right away.</p>
