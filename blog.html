							<h2>Life's a Journey</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">

								<div class="blog-meta">Personal Journey</div>
							</div>
							<p>It's been an amazing journey since graduating from Coding Dojo. I have gone through
							the rollercoaster of applying - both failures and successes. There were times I felt like giving up
							due to lack of responses to my application or HR failure to communicate. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.</p>
							<p><img src="https://i.ibb.co/RYFDndg/mom.jpg"></p>
							<p>It was in these dark times my friends and family held the lamp for me (figure of speech). Most notably,
							the one who kept believing in me was my mother. She taught me to value hard work and patience. I want to wish her a big happy birthday and hope she has many more.</p>
							<p>She used to work as a paper coder while my dad attended school (before I was born). I never knew she did that until she asked me about
							algorithms and coding today. It's pretty crazy just thinking about it. I never knew there was a developer in our family. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't get where I'm at now.</p>
							<p>Thanks Mom. I love you.</p>

							<h2>Job Scammers</h2>

							</div>
							<p>I would like to put it out there as you look for work there will be some unsavory folks
							you will deal with.</p>
							<p>The desire for employment can far outweigh common sense when you encounter those individuals.</p>
							<p>On several occasions I have been contacted out of the blue, for a developer opening. The company or 
							staffing agency is awfully eager to pick me up. You contact them and they request personal information without
							interviewing you. It's a red flag. Don't do it. Just hang up and apply elsewhere. They're trying to phish
							for personal information.</p>
							<p>Another red flag is when the recruiter reaches out to you and does not name the company or the project
							they're working on. I spoke to a supposed CEO of a local startup. He never mentioned the name of his company.
							If you're a local startup don't you want a lot of visibility. Who would give that up?</p>
							<p>You miss a phone call and return the number. Only for the number to be registered to a different individual.
							Call it the bait or switch.</p>
							<p>Be smart and trust your gut instinct. It's likely right.</p>

							<h2>Email Signatures</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Marketing</div>
							</div>
							<p>Email signatures. Everyone has them. However, you want to add them while you're looking for work. Remember you're trying to market yourself.</p>
							<br>
							<p>What goes in an email signature?
							</p>
							
							<p>
								<ul>
								  <li>Name</li>
								  <li>Portfolio Website</li>
								  <li>Title</li>
								  <li>LinkedIn Profile</li>
								  <li>Github Profile</li>
								  <li>Personal Project or Blog</li>
								  <li>Or whatever you want to add? Instagram? etc.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>There are four ways of making signatures:
								<ul>
									<li>A Graphic Design program like Adobe Illustrator or Adobe Photoshop</li>
									<li>Straight up HTML and CSS</li>
									<li>A hybrid of HTML/CSS and a Graphic Design program</li>
									<li>An email signature generator</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>
							  If you're a graphic design afficionado, use Adobe or whatever program you're comfortable with. However, remember to slice up your
							  image to provide specific links to certain parts of the image. I recommend using Mariah's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qexZdD5gP2E">tutorial</a>.
							</p>
							<p>Straight up HTML and CSS is easy to manipulate for signatures but the personalization is lacking. In this instance you want to make a .html file and hardcode the css and html.
							  You're wondering where will I get image hosted for your email signature (your personal picture). It's at your discretion whether you want a personal picture
							  or logo. A good site for hosting images that I found is <a href="https://imgbb.com/">here</a>. PSA your social icons can be found on this good site called <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flaticon</a>. Beware some of the free images are in grayscale, if you have a program that can convert
							  it to RGB then customization can happen.
							  When you finish the email signature, you're wondering how will I
							  add it to your email. For simplicity, we're using Gmail.
								<ul>
									<li>Go to your settings</li>
									<li>Look for the signature setting and select add a signature</li>
									<li>With your html page open, copy the image.</li>
									<li>Paste it in the signature box and viola you're done!</li>
								</ul>
								
							</p>
							<p>However, if you're lost try this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD1YSYtavd4">tutorial</a>.</p>
							<p>If you're good with both coding and graphic manipulation, try this third method. Not only is it easier but your image looks more professional
							and customizations are doable.
							</p>
							<p> There's something easy to manipulate without going through the hastle, try a generator. 
							  Here's a list I compiled:
							   	<ul>
									<li><a href="https://www.hubspot.com/email-signature-generator?utm_id=355242967857&utm_medium=paid&utm_source=google&utm_term=Marketing_free%20email%20signature%20generator_EN&utm_campaign=Q2Campaign_Leads_EN_AdWords_NAM_NAM_FreeESG_e_c_2032690924&hsa_ver=3&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_acc=2734776884&hsa_kw=free%20email%20signature%20generator&hsa_grp=74803853907&hsa_mt=e&hsa_cam=2032690924&hsa_ad=355242967857&hsa_tgt=kwd-68826325694&hsa_src=g&gclid=Cj0KCQiAuefvBRDXARIsAFEOQ9GGpHmwsWtQ5flEQajFrCYQ8RDAxZ1ag6Ck-BCg1BlhC_3HNMWV2U0aAkwzEALw_wcB">Hubspot</a>- It uses
									a very simple API to generate your signature. It's very intuitive and responsive.
									</li>
									<li><a href="https://lnd.wisestamp.com/email-signatures?ws_ncid=672297349&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=cpc&campaignid=957353984&adgroupid=54933460509&keyword=free%20signature%20generator%20email&matchtype=e&adposition=1t3&gclid=Cj0KCQiAuefvBRDXARIsAFEOQ9HhBP39lfDDoGAsEqxzbgjqNWiti2WXQ6lnOL3vCKDaSUDwBn5DfgwaAvNOEALw_wcB&utm_expid=.MNDmKl3WRmGBQrcW9fdi-Q.0&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F">Wise Stamp</a>- Just like HubSpot but adds more functionality to your links. It is compatible to most email boxes.</li>
									<li><a href="https://www.mail-signatures.com/signature-generator/#/user-social-media">Mail Signatures</a>- It's very simple and customizable. However, your social links are kind of limited to the standard Youtube, Instagram, and etc.</li>
								</ul>			
							</p>
							<p>My advice make your signatures responsive as possible. If a recruiter clicks on a link, it should go to the given site. Static images aren't as useful as before from my experience.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions in getting started drop me an email. Take it easy! ^_^</p>

							<h2>Videogame Development: Perception vs Reality</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">FYI</div>
							</div>
							<p>My first taste of videogame development was during my undergrad in college. I had won this competition to visit the headquarters of Vivendi Games. It was pretty cool seeing the developers at work
								writing the code and the designers using Maya to develop the graphics.</p>
							<br>
							<p>I took my first computer and developed a few mods for Fallout 3 and Elder Scrolls Oblivion. It was quite a challenge
							   since I had no programming experience at that time. Trying to teach yourself Papyrus, GECK, Lua, and etc. becomes hectic to say the least. To be honest I think this was the golden age of game
							   development. 
							</p>
							<p>Fast forward a few years I get in to QA with various videogame companies (EA, Activision, Bethesda, 2K, and etc.) I think it's a dream come true having
							   had an amazing experience previously. It was at this time GAAS (Games as a Service) reveals its ugly head. Lootboxes and modification to the player's game using real
							   money starts to happen.
							</p>
							<p>Do you know QA becomes insane during Alpha and Beta tests? Lots of gamers do not know that. I remember not sleeping for a few days in preparation for a launch. The servers
							 were stressed out. Users couldn't access the servers to 'play.' Customer service gets flooded to answer the various questions. "Why is it not working?"
							 Sometimes the company DMs the contractors and testers, "Why is it broken? Can you fix it?"			
							</p>
							<p>Besides sleep being a luxury, you have to adhere to what I call hotfixes coupled with Agile development. Companies usually
							use a task manager setup or a CR (Change Request) to modify the game due to how severe the bug/glitch is. If it's game breaking, say goodbye to more sleep.
							</p>
							<p>Freedom of creative thought. You can come up with the most amazing idea but the leadership has the final say. I want to add this certain functionality but you will likely get shot down, even if
							   it's for the betterment of the user. Time and money does become a factor. As with a business, they have to look at their bottom line.	
							</p>
							<p>Dog eat dog world. After doing QA for a few years I have never seen co-workers intentionally try to mess up their coworker. The reason
							   being, inefficiency and quota standards. The budget is only afforded for a certain time, let's say 6 developers for 6 months. Then half of the QA is cut.
							</p>
							<p>This does not apply to all companies but just from my experience. If you can find a good Indie game company that 
							   treats their developers and QA team with respect and courtesy.. I say go for it!

							<h2>Final Technical Interview</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
							</div>
							<p>I had my technical interview this past Wednesday. The cool part it was at Starbucks. The technical in person was very similar to my CACI interview but more on the technical side (it is a technical interview).</p>
							<p>It was very similar to my CACI interview in terms of the laid back attitude. As my brother says, just be yourself.</p>
							<br>
							<p>Here's a list:</p>
							<br>
							<p><em>Using Git. Elaborate on it.</em></p>
							<br>
							 <p><b>I know at Coding Dojo we used it for source code control. We had to do the standard commits and inits. I have done git pull requests
							 However, working in a team you have to make use of <em>merge.</em> I'll be honest I have not used merge before. One reason we never worked in
							 team projects. Git merge would really be helpful for that scenario. That's what I emphasize doing group projects at Coding Dojo to get a taste 
							 for another team member's code and make it work with yours.</b></p>
							<br>
							<p><em>C#. How long have you coded it? Error checking? IDE of choice? and...LINQ queries</em></p>
							 <br>
							 <p><b>My C# experience has been with the Dojo itself. Many people tend to learn C# to get in to game development, especially with Unity. Many game developers
							 still use C++ as their go to language. I'm not fond of it as it's not error friendly compared to C#. A memory leak is not an error that elaborates where it's happening at in your line 
							 of code. The error code checking I've done is pretty much my try catch method or the standard console log. With majority of software companies they tend to run
							 their code through a script that scans it. This goes through a test driven development process. Yes. I'm looking at you QA employees. For IDE I admitted I love Atom because it looks pretty. However,
							 if you're using C#, VS code is your go to. There's an extension I have to download for error checking. In terms of LINQ, I definitely think the Dojo should elaborate on it. In all my C# technical interviews, LINQ queries are important. Many
							 applications are moving away from legacy software like Silverlight and upgrading their applications in the process. Some applications still use a database like SQL where it's heavy on the statements.</b></p>
							<br>
							<p><em>Angular. Javascript. Typescript. How did you use it?</em></p>
							<br>
							<p><b>They asked me about my Angular experience. I used it at the Dojo during my last stack. I explained the promises and observables (especially with ES5 and ES6 standards). I did mention that I've done Vanilla Javascript as well. The interviewer asked me if I've coded a full application and I mentioned I did but it was all in Javascript.</b></p>
							<br>
							<p><em>Microlibraries?</em></p>
							<br>
							<p><b>I got confused by this question. The libraries I remember from C# were importing like LINQ. I admitted I've used APIs in my coding standards especially with Javascript. I would love to apply an API with Python in the future, especially with the rise of machine learning (I'm looking at your Alexa).</b></p>
					                <br>
							<p>There were some more questions but there was so much data crammed that I forgot. Seriously, these C# technical interviews are looking more and more similar to each other. It's uncanny. I want to give a shoutout to Anaba! Have a safe trip! ^_^</p>

							<h2>Interview with CACI</h2>
							<div class="blog-metas">
								<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
								<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
							</div>
							<p>I had my interview with CACI yesterday. I'll be honest I did apply to this job on a whim. My brother had told me why don't apply to CACI. He had been with the company for 10 years. Ed had nothing but amazing things to say about them. He mentioned if it wasn't for them
							his network engineering career wouldn't have gotten this far. In the end, he said: "just be yourself sis."
							</p><p>Originally my interview was supposed to be a 6 panel interview with the team. Majority of the team was out of town due to Thanksgiving week. It went from
							6 to 2 people. I know at Boeing I had a 5 person interview where I had to do ERD diagraming and scripting.</p>
							<p>The project manager was cool. He seemed so nice and down to Earth. The PMs in my past have either been high strung (sends an email at 2am and expects a response at that time) or MIA. I really don't know which is worse. He was more 
							about behavorial questions, previous projects, working in an agile environment, team structure, how do you learn?, etc.
							</p>
							<p>The second interviewer was one of their senior developers. He seemed pretty chill as well. The developer asked:</p>
							<br>
							<p>Penetration testing and Python</p>
							<p>C# projects and what they do</p>
							<p>Validation libraries (I've made a custom validator but usually everything is hardcoded in)</p>
							<p>Object Relational Mapping - ERD Diagraming with SQL</p>
							<p>Frontend, Backend, which do you prefer?</p>
							<p>Javascript. Typescript. Explain it. How did you use it?</p>
							<br>
							<p>The questions were pretty straightforward. In retrospect, I could of elaborated on it more.
							</p>
							<p>Now to prepare for my next interview next Wednesday. I have to catch up on my old Python scripts and continuously learn C#. I still need to upload my old 'hacking' scripts to Github.</p>
							<p>Have a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!</p>

							</div>
							<p>I've been working with the Autism society to get some of their websites up to code (...literally).</p>
							<p>My task was to support this static website in PHP (which isn't my cup of tea). I can't stand it. Sorry to you PHP lovers. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>The client told me they want their website to be:</em></p>
							<p>
							<br>
							A. Responsive
							<br>
							B. Login/Registration (thank you Coding Dojo for those Python and C# belt exams)
							<br>
							C. The website must support multiple languages
							<br>
							D. Colorblind users
							<br>
							E. Realtime Facebook and Twitter feed 
							<br>
							F. Calendar of Events
							<br>
							G. Must accept payments (Paypal for user yearly fees)
							<br>
							H. Implement a lottery system
							<br>
							I. Implement a digital wall
							</p> 
							<p>I mentioned to the Senior Developer that the website needs a huge overhaul. He stated the only way he will allow any changes is to develop a wireframe and make a dummy website. 
							<p>I am so tempted to:</p>
							<p>
							 A. Cheat and Wordpress the site in to the ground...
							<br> 
							 B. Apply a Framework like Angular or React
						        <br>
							 C. Do both?....
							</p>
							<p>Did I mention I have only 2 weeks to complete this :(</p>

									<h2>Tackling a non technical interview</h2>
									<div class="blog-metas">
										<div class="blog-meta">By Kate</div>
										<div class="blog-meta">Interviewing</div>
									</div>
									<p>Majority of my interviews have been technical. It usually starts out: HR contacts you, technical
										interview with conceptual questions in regards to the code, coding challenge, in person interview (2
										parts the technical and the behavorial). </p>
									<p>What makes a non technical interview harder? Your resume. How can I sell myself? Resumes only show a
										small part of the candidate. My interview last Monday was laid back which was refreshing for once
										instead of the stressful I'm going to pullout my hair. I was in a panel interview with 2 Senior
										Developers and 1 Project Manager. The Project Manager was really friendly and was an advocate in my
										corner. However, coming in as a junior you will be
										under scrutiny. What is your source control? How are you applying your software coding to security
										standards in a DISA format? When the lead developer says they have 40000 vulnerabilities
										alone in the code, you get kind of apprehensive. Looking back at all my Github repositories it makes me
										question maybe I should of called a certain object or variable differently. However, don't take these
									interviews lightly. Sometimes, they're even harder than the technical ones.</p>

							</div>
							<p>Where do I fit?</p>
							<p>Am I one of the three?</p>
							<p>If you're Front-End be prepared for a tougher process than backend or full stack. Remember Front-End is the face of the website. Do you believe a company will allow you to code their multimillion dollar app with nothing but CSS and HTML? The answer is...<em>No.</em>
							You will go through multiple interviews. I have been through 4 levels of the interviewing process for a front end position. The HR, technical with the senior developer, coding challenge, and the in person.
							Your Javascript, jQuery, and AJAX skills have to be on point. Do you know the difference between null vs undefined? What is hoisting? Lifecycles of different frameworks (Angular vs React vs Vue)?
							</p>
							<p>If you're Back-End you will have the standard coding challenge. If you pass it, you make it to the final interview with the hiring manager and team. Don't forget about whiteboarding..</p>
							<p>If you're Full-Stack be prepared to make an app that is both pretty and functional. It's the same process as the Back-End.</p>

								</div>
								<p>Should I apply directly to the company?</p>
								<p>..or should I use a Staffing Agency?</p>
								<p>The answer is it depends. To get your foot through the door most candidates go through a staffing agency. Usually, these agencies are 6 month contracts
								that will eventually lead to a permanent position (depending on your performance).
								</p>
								<p>If you apply directly, there is no middle man. However, it will take some time depending how big the HR team is. Sometimes, you get an interview right away.</p>
